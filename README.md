# HTML-and-CSS

This repository contains the work that I've done in the HTML and CSS course from the Tech Academy's Software Developer Course

# Project Explanations

Each folder has work that was done in different lessons in HTML and CSS. There is also a folder that represents the beginning of
my work to learn JavaScript. 

# Webpage Projects

If you would like to see a website I've made in the wild, please visit "govtchris.github.io". This site show some of my personality 
and links to my GiHub profile. 

There are several other folders that contain some basic work I've done with HTML and CSS to make websites. 

Take a look around! Most of the pages will be updated as I move through the courses and learn more on my own!
